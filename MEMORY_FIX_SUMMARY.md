# Memory Issue Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

The agent was unable to add memories because of a **tool name mapping mismatch** in the memory system.

### Root Cause

There were inconsistent tool names across different parts of the system:

1. **Client Agent** (`agents/client_agent.py`): 
   - Was calling: `memory.add_conversation`
   - Expected tool name: `memory_conversation_add`

2. **Tool Executor** (`runtime/tool_executor.py`):
   - **Before fix**: Had loaded the tool as `memory.conversation.add`
   - **Service mappings**: Had correct mapping as `memory.add_conversation`

3. **Result**: When the client agent tried to call `memory.add_conversation`, it failed because the tool executor had loaded it as `memory.conversation.add` instead.

## Fix Applied

**File**: `runtime/tool_executor.py`  
**Lines**: 91-97

**Changed from:**
```python
self.available_tools.update({
    "memory.conversation.add": conversation_add,
    "memory.conversation.retrieve": conversation_retrieve,
    "memory.execution.add": execution_add,
    "memory.execution.retrieve": execution_retrieve,
    "memory.get_profile": get_profile
})
```

**Changed to:**
```python
self.available_tools.update({
    "memory.add_conversation": conversation_add,
    "memory.retrieve_conversation": conversation_retrieve,
    "memory.add_execution": execution_add,
    "memory.retrieve_execution": execution_retrieve,
    "memory.get_profile": get_profile
})
```

## Verification

All memory tool names are now consistent across the codebase:

✅ **Client Agent calls**: `memory.add_conversation`  
✅ **Tool Executor loads**: `memory.add_conversation`  
✅ **Service mapping**: `memory.add_conversation`

### Schema Validation

The fix also ensures that the agent gets the correct schemas for the add command:

- **Pydantic Model**: `execute_memory_conversation_add_input`
- **Client Schema**: `memory_conversation_add` input schema
- **Required Fields**: `message_id`, `explanation`, `user_input`, `agent_response`
- **Optional Fields**: `timestamp`, `meta_data`

## Impact

This fix resolves the "I notice there were some errors storing the memory" issue that the agent was experiencing. The agent should now be able to:

1. ✅ Add conversation memories successfully
2. ✅ Add execution memories successfully  
3. ✅ Retrieve memories from the system
4. ✅ Get proper validation feedback

## Additional Notes

- All other memory tools (retrieve_conversation, add_execution, retrieve_execution, get_profile) were also corrected for consistency
- The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server communication layer was unaffected by this fix
- User ID handling remains properly implemented for memory operations

# Memory Process Cleanup Fix

## Problem Summary
Memory processes in the client agent were hanging after SSE (Server-Sent Events) edits of the memory MCP, causing the agent to not shut down properly.

## Root Causes
1. **Persistent SSE Connections**: The memory MCP client maintains long-lived SSE connections that weren't being closed properly
2. **Untracked Background Tasks**: The insights agent was creating fire-and-forget async tasks that continued running after the main process tried to exit
3. **No Cleanup on Exit**: The global MCP client singleton wasn't being cleaned up on process termination
4. **Missing Timeouts**: Memory operations could hang indefinitely without timeout protection

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. Background Task Tracking
Added task tracking to `ClientAgent` to monitor and clean up background tasks:
```python
# Track background tasks for cleanup
self._background_tasks: set[asyncio.Task] = set()

def _track_background_task(self, task: asyncio.Task):
    """Track a background task and remove it when done"""
    self._background_tasks.add(task)
    task.add_done_callback(lambda t: self._background_tasks.discard(t))
```

### 2. Cleanup Method
Implemented comprehensive cleanup in `ClientAgent`:
```python
async def cleanup(self):
    """Cleanup resources including background tasks and MCP connections"""
    # Cancel all background tasks
    for task in self._background_tasks:
        if not task.done():
            task.cancel()
    
    # Wait for all tasks to complete or be cancelled
    if self._background_tasks:
        await asyncio.gather(*self._background_tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    
    # Close MCP client connection
    await close_mcp_client()
```

### 3. Context Manager Support
Added context manager protocol to `ClientAgent` for automatic cleanup:
```python
async def __aenter__(self):
    return self

async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
    await self.cleanup()
    return False
```

### 4. CLI Interface Cleanup
Updated CLI interface to call cleanup on exit:
```python
finally:
    # Cleanup on exit
    print("\nðŸ§¹ Cleaning up resources...")
    await self.agent.cleanup()
    print("âœ… Cleanup complete")
```

### 5. Operation Timeouts
Added 30-second timeouts to memory operations to prevent indefinite hanging:
```python
async with asyncio.timeout(30):  # 30 second hard timeout
    # Memory operation code
```

## Usage Examples

### With Context Manager (Recommended)
```python
async with ClientAgent() as agent:
    result = await agent.process_request("Hello", user_id="user123")
    # Cleanup happens automatically on exit
```

### Manual Cleanup
```python
agent = ClientAgent()
try:
    result = await agent.process_request("Hello", user_id="user123")
finally:
    await agent.cleanup()
```

## Testing
A test script (`test_memory_cleanup.py`) is provided to verify:
1. Normal operation with automatic cleanup
2. Interrupt handling and graceful shutdown
3. Timeout behavior for hanging operations

Run the test with:
```bash
python test_memory_cleanup.py
```

## Benefits
1. **No More Hanging Processes**: All background tasks and connections are properly cleaned up
2. **Graceful Shutdown**: The agent shuts down cleanly even when interrupted
3. **Timeout Protection**: Operations that hang are automatically cancelled after 30 seconds
4. **Resource Management**: Better control over system resources with proper cleanup

## Migration Notes
- Existing code using `ClientAgent` should preferably use the context manager pattern
- If manual instantiation is used, ensure `cleanup()` is called on exit
- The CLI interface automatically handles cleanup, no changes needed for CLI users

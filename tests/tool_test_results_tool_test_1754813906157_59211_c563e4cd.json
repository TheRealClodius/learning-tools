The Air Quality Index, or AQI, was created as an easy way to\ncorrelate levels of different pollutants to one scale. The higher\nthe AQI value, the greater the health concern.\n\nWhen pollution levels are elevated, the New York State Department of\nHealth recommends that individuals consider limiting strenuous\noutdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health\neffects. People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of\nelevated levels of pollutants include the very young, and those with\npreexisting respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.\nThose with symptoms should consider consulting their personal\nphysician.\n\nFor additional information, please visit the New York State\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation website at,\nhttps://on.ny.gov/nyaqi, or call the Air Quality Hotline at\n1 800 5 3 5, 1 3 4 5.",

          "answer": "The latest developments in AI agent technology in 2025 focus on **agentic AI systems** that combine generative AI with autonomous decision-making to improve productivity, automation, and user interaction across industries.\n\nKey advancements include:\n\n- **Google Cloud\u2019s Conversational Agents Console** uses the latest Gemini models to create AI agents with human-like voices, emotional comprehension, and adaptive conversations. It features tools for evaluating and monitoring agent performance at scale, improving reliability and quality in self-service experiences[1].\n\n- **IBM AskIAM** integrates agentic AI into identity and access management, automating provisioning and access requests while enhancing security through advanced intelligence and automation. It supports open architectures leveraging large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)[1].\n\n- **Microsoft\u2019s new AI agents** assist with complex tasks such as data analysis, cybersecurity, and secure AI development. For example, Microsoft Security Copilot includes agents that autonomously triage phishing alerts and insider risk incidents, freeing human teams for higher-level tasks[3].\n\n- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** introduced agentic AI tools that automate complex, multi-step business processes with minimal human input, aiming to reduce operational overhead and accelerate innovation in enterprises[4].\n\n- The concept of an **agentic AI mesh** is emerging as a new architectural paradigm. It is a modular, distributed, and vendor-neutral environment where multiple AI agents collaborate autonomously across systems. This mesh supports composability, distributed intelligence, layered decoupling, vendor neutrality, and governed autonomy to ensure safe and scalable agent operation[5].\n\n- **Multiagent systems** are under active development, enabling networks of autonomous agents to orchestrate work collaboratively, outperforming single-agent models in complex environments. These systems are increasingly multimodal, integrating capabilities like computer vision and natural language processing to handle diverse data types[2].\n\n- Additional breakthroughs include **Crescendo.ai and Amazon\u2019s integration of Nova Sonic**, a high-speed LLM model, to deliver the fastest, most natural multilingual AI voice support, enhancing real-time voice assistance at scale[4].\n\nOverall, 2025 is marked by rapid evolution in agentic AI, emphasizing **autonomy, collaboration, multimodal reasoning, and enterprise-grade governance** to enable AI agents that are more flexible, reliable, and capable of handling complex workflows across industries[1][2][3][4][5].",

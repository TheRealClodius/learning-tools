We were discussing on our autopilot for agents pow-wow some potential challenges that could exist to the e2e UX (beyond unifying to common design patterns) with a common chassis (vs. more specialized + segregated autopilots). @Tomasz Religa has some war stories from his time at Microsoft and what was attempted with Copilot in the Office suite he'd be happy to share\n\nLet us know what you

@Hadley Robin it would be great if we can work in parallel as we'll need a list of every type of Autopilot feature that any of the product teams currently have on their roadmap and how it's expressed.\nIdeally in a google sheet with title+screenshot (if available) + description (what it does).\n\n@jeffin.philip has done an audit on some of this stuff as it exists in the platform in the little time he had, but we need a more detailed scope as it's not clear what those features actually do.\n\n\u2022 For example: some inline buttons seem to open up suggestions & show a magic wand, but they just open up the autopilot side panel. some are related to AP-powered search, but it's not AP it's just a simple RAG that has little to do with our AP experience.\n---\n**Result 3:**\nChannel:

    "Explore the organizational structure and taxonomy of the tool registry to understand how tools are categorized and what's available in each domain.",
    "Use this to get a high-level map of tool capabilities, understand the scope of each category, and discover new areas of functionality you might not have considered.",
    "Perfect for initial exploration when you're not sure what category your task fits into, or when planning complex workflows that might span multiple categories.",
    "The sample_tools feature shows representative tools from each category to help you understand what each category covers.",
    "Tool counts reveal the depth of functionality in each area.",
    "Filter by implementation_type to see what's available through different backends (REST APIs, MCP servers, etc.).",
    "Essential for strategic tool selection and understanding the relationship between different functional areas."

    "Search for tools in the registry using semantic queries, filters, and advanced search criteria.",
    "This is the primary discovery mechanism when you need to find tools that match specific capabilities, solve particular problems, or work within certain constraints.",
    "Use this when you have a task to accomplish but aren't sure which tool to use, or when you need to find alternatives to known tools.",
    "The search supports multiple modes: semantic search through descriptions and capabilities, exact matching by tags or categories, and filtered browsing by implementation type or complexity.",
    "Best for exploratory discovery, finding tools by capability rather than name, and understanding what tools are available for specific use cases.",
    "Supports pagination for large result sets and can include full schemas when you need to validate tool compatibility before use."
